This repository includes the files for the paper of "Applying Deep Learning to the Newsvendor Problem". 
Also, the basket dataset will be included. Currently the code to generate simulated datasets is included.  

The main file to run is `rQ_dnn.py`, which includes all the functions to train both the newsvendor and rQ model.
